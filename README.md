Inspired by [this video clip](https://youtu.be/sFCkywDgjQQ)

(Not really, but great inspiration no?)

This project was really inspired by a desire to improve documentation of Github projects, written by, mostly, non-native
English speakers to flow more naturally to a native English speaker's ears (or eyes) from the United States (American of course more accurately including North, Central, and South Americans).  The first goal is intended to focus on spelling correction, followed by adjusting the style of phrasing to be, well, pardon the ignorance, American!

To start your Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
